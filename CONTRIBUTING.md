# Contributing

Contributions are always welcome!
So thank you already for participating!

Don't be put off by the following hints.
They are intended as a suggestion rather than a strict template.
You make our work easier and contribute to the good quality of the project if you implement as much of it as possible in advance.

## Issues

Before you create an issue, please check if there is already an issue on the topic.
If so, please comment there.

Please check carefully which version (version number or commit) you are using and let us know.
The latest changes are currently in the develop branch.
It may be that bugs are already fixed there or features are already implemented in it.

## Coding

It would be nice if the code meets the following requirements and you already consider them when coding:

* for python code, a test coverage of 100% is expected for the new code components
* please introduce as few new dependencies as possible
* no superfluous white spaces
* the default value for tabs is 4 spaces

## Pull requests

Please check the status in the "develop" branch. This may have already developed considerably from the main branch.

Before submitting a pull request, please ask yourself the following questions:

* The code works and does not break other functionality?
* If you have implemented a new feature, are you willing to continue to maintain it?
* Are there sufficient and appropriate tests for the code?
* Does the code affect the deployment process (e.g. pip, ansible, docker, GitHub workflows)?
* Do your changes relate to and reference issues or milestones?
* Did you check the code with some linter?
* Have you checked your code for leftover to-dos or other things from debugging?
* Is the contributed code sufficiently commented so that an outsider can understand the functionality?
* Did you spell check comments and visible strings?
* Do your changes require adjustments to the readme or wiki?
* Are changes to the API and / or API clients necessary?
